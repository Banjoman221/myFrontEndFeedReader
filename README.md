## To Successfully run
To successfully run this app you must:

1. Go to my github front end feed reader page download the zip file by going to the clone or download button and download the required zip file.

2. Once you download the files to run the app you must locate the index.html file and run it in a compatible browser.

Note - If you would like to clone the files go to your git console and type in:

git clone https://github.com/Banjoman221/myFrontEndFeedReader.git

then follow the second step to run the Feed Reader app.

To successfully pass all the test in jasmine.js:

1. The allFeeds array must be defined and its names and urls should not be empty.
2. The menu must be hidden by default and should hide or show when clicked on
3. The loadFeed function should produce at least one entry in the feed container.
4. Every time the loadFeed function is called the content should change.
